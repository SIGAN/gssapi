The routine may return a output_token, which should be transferred to the peer application, which will present it to gss_accept_sec_context. If no token need be sent, gss_init_sec_context() will indicate this by setting the length field of the output_token argument to zero. To complete context establishment, one or more reply tokens may be required from the peer application; if so, gss_init_sec_context() will return a status code that contains the supplementary information bit GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED . In this case, make another call to gss_init_sec_context() when the reply token is received from the peer application and pass the reply token to gss_init_sec_context() by means of the input_token parameter.</para>

For example, if the application requests a service such as delegation or anonymous authentication by means of the req_flags argument, and the service is unavailable from the underlying mechanism, gss_init_sec_context() generates a token that will not provide the service, and it indicate by means of the ret_flags argument that the service will not be supported.
